# Visual Testing at Scale - Built at HackRx 4.0

**Tranied A.I. model that can Test UI design and rate it on a scale of 10. We used Bajaj Finserv's website screenshots as a dataset by web scrapping using selenium. Collected over 750+ screenshots of UI Designs. Also developed equally same fake dataset by automation. We achieved an accuracy of 97% in the first phase. In the second phase, we used more similar types of datasets with less deviation in realness and fakeness to achieve more accuracy.**

- **This AI Model consists of ResNet-50 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet datasets. We applied transfer learning with our customized dataset of UI Designs.**
- **Future work includes the parallel connection of YOLOv5 to detect the various UI components present in the UI design with a previously trained model. This will help in generating a detailed report of the UI Design as per the requirements of the tester. _(For this part of implementation kindly draft a mail to : kyghelani2@gmail.com )_**
